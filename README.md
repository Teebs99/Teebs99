# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Stephen and I am a back-end engineer!

I write code in C#, Python, and Go, and love solving complex problems!

## Professional Projects
---
I currently work at [Emarsys](https://emarsys.com/) transforming products from our first-party data center to the cloud.

### Responsibilities
#### Emarsys
- Coordinate with teams to lift and shift our flagship product to create automated environments in the cloud.
- Decide how the organization will collect telemetry data across 50+ internal tools, reducing cost by ~70%.
- Monitor the organization's telemetry migration, and create internal tools that saved over 200 development hours.
